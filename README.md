# What's this?  

*Scratch Messages API* is an API to retrieve info about the logged-in user's messages or inbox on the website [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) by MIT Lifelong Kindergarten Group.  
It does this through JavaScript, with a simple function that takes an options object and a callback function, with an API similar to the one used in Scratch's own website API (see [LLK/scratch-rest-api](https://github.com/LLK/scratch-rest-api))
